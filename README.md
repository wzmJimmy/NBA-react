# NBA-react
A NBA player information and statistics exhibition webpage based on React. <br/>
The basic player infomation is maintained by https://github.com/bttmly/nba, while graph drawing is based on d3-hexbin.<br/>
Ant design is used for uniform layout style and convinience.<br/>

The demo on aws server is still deploying. An exhibition vedio is attached in Google doc instead: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rgBVPxwhT-RRDHLuUEqfABO817It4jqO?usp=sharing
